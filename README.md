# SortingAlgoVISUALIZATION

Nowadays sorting algorithms are widely used in computer software. For example,
if you open ﬁle explorer on your PC, you may see ﬁles sorted in diﬀerent ways.
Searching in sorted data is more eﬃcient than in not sorted ones. Students of
computer science start learning diﬀerent algorithms in the ﬁrst year of studies
and sorting algorithms are among them.

Since I faced the problems of sorting during the course of algorithm design
in the ﬁrst year of my studies, there is an understanding that the visual representation
is a vital part of the studying process. During working on the project
it was very exciting to learn diﬀerent techniques of sorting algorithms into the
depth.

The main goal of the project was to create a program which would serve as a
tool for understanding how most known sorting algorithms work. There was an
attempt to make the best possible user experience. The demonstration software
is made in a user-friendly and easy-to-use style. To gain maximal beneﬁt from
learning you can try each sorting algorithm on your data.


The text of the project describes principles of the most known sorting algorithms
which are demonstrated in the computer program. It might be used as
a source for learning algorithms by students. Also, the program might be easily
used as a demonstration by lecturers and tutors during classes. Besides, there is
programmer documentation and user guide to the provided software.


Readers of this text are expected to have some programming experience to
know basic data structures such as arrays, lists, trees and understand recursive
procedures. Also, knowledge of some simple algorithms and their implementa-
tions could be helpful. In order to understand the topic better, knowledge of
linear algebra and calculus is involved.
